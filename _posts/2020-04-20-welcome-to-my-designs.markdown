Welcome to my design portal, showcasing some of my work in designing high quality graphics for a wide varity of customers. 
Please feel free to visit my [Instagram page for details.](https://www.instagram.com/{{ site.author.instagram_username }}).

My primary goal is to provide attractive content for your audience in a timely manner. My capability ranges from doing logos, posters and among others. Say it and I'll design it. 

Additionally, I'm a product of Jamaica, the positive vibration of Reggae music is in my bones. It has been apart of my culture and this beautiful art has captured the world in so many ways. I continue to share the positive vibrations as a disk jocket bearing then DJ Ray. And as the great Bob Marley once said: `one good thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain.` Feel free to reach out & I can hit you with music.
